# Check and match genotype data
In this repo we host some tools that we use to evaluate genotype data that we generate at CGI. Most of the tools is geared towards the data set we generate in monitoring wildlife populations in Sweden. The focus is on making it simple to match new genotype data with data that are available in databases.
